# About Me

I'm a 20-year-old junior at the University of Florida with a strong focus in computer graphics. I began teaching myself visual effects at 14 using After Effects and Blender, which eventually led to founding <a href="https://www.effxcts.com" target="_blank">Effxcts LLC</a>— a sports VFX company with 50M+ views and clients including ESPN, NHL, Red Bull, and more.

In college, my interests expanded to coding, image processing, computer vision, and all the visual aspects of technology. This past summer, I interned as a Machine Learning Software Engineer at the <a href="https://www.chop.edu/" target="_blank">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</a> (CHOP), where I applied image processing and machine learning to predict surgical needs from renogram imaging.

Currently, I’m working on publishing those results, researching at the <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~eragan/indie.html" target="_blank">Indie Lab</a>, exploring new projects in computer graphics, and seeking a summer 2025 internship to continue contributing to this field.

Outside of this, I enjoy basketball, flag football, and skiing.

## Current Interests & Projects
3D Reconstruction, Diffusion Models, Gaussian Splatting, Pose Estimation

### Pose Estimaton for Automatic Video Creation
Creating a program automates creating a video like <a href="https://x.com/ari_fararooy/status/1604536193227427841" target="_blank">this</a>, utilizing web scraping, pose estimation, computer vision, and image segmentation.

## Past Projects
### Renogram Analysis - Deep Learning and Image Processing
During my CHOP internship, I developed a Python pipeline to extract quantitative data from over 300 renogram images. I trained and validated models, including a neural network (CNN-LSTM), to predict surgical necessity. To support clinical use, I created two web tools with REST APIs: one for automated renogram analysis and another for drawing renogram curves for model interpretability.

### Basketball Shot Tracker - ML & Computer Vision
I developed a real-time basketball shot tracker by training a YOLOv8 deep learning model and implementing data-cleaning algorithms. The project achieved 95% score detection accuracy and 97% shot attempt accuracy.

### 3D Depth Screen Illusion - Computer Vision
I created an algorithm that adjusts 2D layers based on real-time eye tracking data to simulate 3D depth on a 2D screen.

### NBA Blender 3D Data Visualization
I developed a GUI to visualize NBA player shooting heat maps using data from the NBA API. I then extended this into a 3D visualization, scripting 500 models to follow physics-based shooting arcs in Blender. This project reached over 4 million views on TikTok and Instagram.
