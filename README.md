# About Me

I'm a 20-year-old junior at the University of Florida with a strong focus in computer graphics. I began teaching myself visual effects at 14 using After Effects and Blender, which eventually led to founding <a href="https://www.effxcts.com" target="_blank">Effxcts LLC</a>— a sports VFX company with 50M+ views and clients including ESPN, NHL, Red Bull, and more.

In college, my interests expanded to coding, image processing, computer vision, and all the visual aspects of technology. This past summer, I interned as a Machine Learning Software Engineer at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where I applied image processing and machine learning to predict surgical needs from renogram imaging.

Currently, I’m working on publishing those results, exploring new projects in computer graphics, and seeking a summer 2025 internship to continue contributing to this field.

Outside of this, I enjoy basketball, flag football, and skiing.

## Current Interests & Projects
3D Reconstruction, Diffusion Models, Pose Estimation, Building VFX Tools.

### Pose Estimaton for Automatic Video Creation
Creating a program automates creating a video like <a href="https://x.com/ari_fararooy/status/1604536193227427841" target="_blank">this</a>, utilizing web scraping, pose estimation, computer vision, and image segmentation.

### 4D Gaussian Splatting
The ambitious goal is to transform sports footage into near real-time temporal Gaussian splats, enabling viewers to watch the game from any angle imaginable.

## Past Projects
### Renogram Analysis - Deep Learning and Image Processing
During my internship at CHOP, I developed an image processing pipeline in Python to extract quantitative data from over 300 renogram images. To predict surgical necessity, I trained three models including a convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), all validated with 5-fold cross-validation. For clinical utility, I also developed two interactive web tools using REST APIs: one for automated renogram analysis and another for drawing renogram curves to aid in model interpretability <a href="https://renogram-drawing.onrender.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.


### Basketball Shot Tracker Using ML & Computer Vision

<a href="https://github.com/avishah3/AI-Basketball-Shot-Detection-Tracker" target="_blank">Github Project</a>

I developed a real-time basketball shot tracker by training a YOLOv8 deep learning model and implementing data-cleaning algorithms. The project achieved 95% score detection accuracy and 97% shot attempt accuracy.

### 3D Depth Screen Illusion
<a href="https://github.com/avishah3/3D-Screen-Illusion-Using-Webcam" target="_blank">Github Project</a>

I created an algorithm that adjusts 2D layers based on real-time eye tracking data to simulate 3D depth on a 2D screen.

### NBA Blender 3D Data Visualization
<a href="https://github.com/avishah3/DSA-final-project" target="_blank">Github Project</a>

I developed a GUI to visualize NBA player shooting heat maps using data from the NBA API. I then extended this into a 3D visualization, scripting over 500 models to follow physics-based shooting arcs. This project reached over 4 million views on TikTok and Instagram.
