# About Me

I'm a 20-year-old junior at the University of Florida with a strong focus in computer graphics. I began teaching myself visual effects at 14 using After Effects and Blender, which eventually led to founding <a href="https://www.effxcts.com" target="_blank">Effxcts LLC</a>— a sports VFX company with 50M+ views and clients including ESPN, NHL, Red Bull, and more.

In college, my interests expanded to coding, image processing, computer vision, and all the visual aspects of technology. This past summer, I interned as a Machine Learning Software Engineer at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where I applied image processing and machine learning to predict surgical needs from renogram imaging.

Currently, I’m working on publishing those results, exploring new projects in computer graphics, and seeking a summer 2025 internship to continue contributing to this field.

Outside of this, I enjoy basketball, flag football, and skiing.

## Current Interests & Projects
3D Reconstruction, Diffusion Models, Pose Estimation, Building VFX Tools.

### Pose Estimaton for Automatic Video Creation
Creating a program automates creating a video like <a href="https://x.com/ari_fararooy/status/1604536193227427841" target="_blank">this</a> utilizing web scraping, pose estimation, computer vision, and image segmentation.

### 4D Gaussian Splatting
Developing programs to convert videos into animated 3D visualizations using Gaussian splatting. The ambitious goal is to transform sports footage into near real-time temporal Gaussian splats, enabling viewers to watch the game from any angle imaginable.

## Past Projects
### Automated renogram analysis with deep learning and image processing
During my internship at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, I developed an image processing pipeline in Python to extract quantitative data from over 300 renogram images. This data, including 34 extracted features and 121 normalized time-series points, was used to train models that predict surgical necessity based on renograms using a logistic regression, random forest, and a convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), all validated with 5-fold cross-validation. To enhance clinical utility, I also developed two interactive web tools using REST APIs: one for automated renogram analysis and another for drawing renogram curves to aid in model interpretability [here](https://renogram-drawing.onrender.com/).


### Basketball Shot Tracker Using ML & Computer Vision
[Github Project](https://github.com/avishah3/AI-Basketball-Shot-Detection-Tracker)

I engineered a real-time basketball shot tracker using YOLOv8, with enhanced training and inference speeds by over 20x through CUDA optimization. The project achieved 95% score detection accuracy and 97% shot attempt accuracy.

### 3D Depth Illusion
[Github Project](https://github.com/avishah3/3D-Screen-Illusion-Using-Webcam)

I created an algorithm that adjusts 2D layers based on real-time eye tracking data to simulate 3D depth on a 2D screen. This project combined computer vision with real-time interaction, using OpenCV for facial tracking and CUDA for seamless performance at 60 fps.

### NBA Blender 3D Data Visualization
[Github Project](https://github.com/avishah3/DSA-final-project)

I developed a Python GUI that visualizes NBA player shooting heat maps by extracting and parsing data from the NBA API. The data was then processed in Blender, where I scripted over 500 3D models to follow physics-based shooting arcs. This project explored the intersection of sports data and 3D visualization, resulting in a viral data visualization with over 4 million views on TikTok and Instagram.
